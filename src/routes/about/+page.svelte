    Hello there! I'm Daniel, and this is my website.

    I like history, especially the classics, along with programming. I
    enjoy reading about Greek and Roman history, and I study Ancient Greek
    during my free time after taking a course in my last semester of
    collegeâ€“it really is such a cool language.

    To pay the bills, I work as a software engineer on wacky infrastructure
    stuff. Part of the reason why I started this website is because I wanted a place
    where I can write about topics I don't understand well. Studying
    computer science in college certainly gave me a good foundation of theory, but
    I found that I don't have a great understanding of how many things in our daily
    trade of creating and deploying software really work. Perhaps some day I'll
    have confidence that I actually know what I'm doing!

    Other than that, perhaps I'll post about any other ramblings that come to
    mind.

    Assuming I have enough energy after work, I hope to be able to
    post fairly often here.

    Enjoy!
